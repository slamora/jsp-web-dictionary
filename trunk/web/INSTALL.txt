# COMMON PROBLEMS #
###################

1) javax.naming.NamingException: Could not create resource factory instance
[Root exception is java.lang.ClassNotFoundException:
org.apache.tomcat.dbcp.dbcp.BasicDataSourceFactory]

 -> Solution: copy (download) naming-factory-dbcp.jar into 
 	/usr/share/tomcat5.5/common/lib/ directory  
	(some GNU/Linux distributions don't have it by default)


2) Datasource: Cannot load JDBC driver class 'com.mysql.jdbc.Driver'

 -> Solution: check that you have the "mysql-connector-java.jar". Frecuently 
	it can be in the /usr/share/java path and you only must make a simbolic 
	link in /usr/share/tomcat5.5/common/lib
	#> ln -s /usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java.jar mysql-connector-java.jar


3) Cannot create PoolableConnectionFactory (Communications link failure Last 
	packet sent to the server was 0 ms ago.)

 -> Solution: Add to the policy file  /etc/tomcat6/policy.d/04webapps.policy:
	 grant codeBase "file:/var/lib/tomcat5.5/webapps/jspWebDict/-" {
       permission java.net.SocketPermission "localhost:3306", "connect,resolve";
	 };
